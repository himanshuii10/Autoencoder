# Autoencoder-MNIST-Compression is a deep learning project that implements an autoencoder using Keras to compress and reconstruct images from the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The project demonstrates dimensionality reduction, unsupervised learning, and image reconstruction using neural networks.

#   Project Overview
✅ Built an autoencoder that compresses 784-dimensional MNIST images into a 32-dimensional latent space
✅ Trained the autoencoder using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss
✅ Visualized the original and reconstructed images
✅ Achieved good reconstruction quality while significantly reducing dimensionality

# Key Concepts
Autoencoder: Neural network trained to encode input into low-dimensional representation and reconstruct the input.
Dimensionality reduction: Compressed the image data from 784 to 32 dimensions.
Unsupervised learning: Labels not required; model learns to reconstruct input data.

# Future Enhancements
Experiment with different latent space dimensions.
Add convolutional autoencoder architecture for better image reconstruction.
Apply to other datasets like Fashion-MNIST or CIFAR-10.
